This is cloned from `git@github.com:jekyll/minima.git` to reduce complexity. I added to have comments function enabled. All you need to do is to copy all the files here, to serve as a starting point of your blog.

All you need to get started is to copy all the files to your own public GitHub repo, and then start blogging by added a file to _posts directory. Check out the two files there as example!

The Gemfile and stuff are here so you can run the Jekyll stack locally. Use `bundle install` to install necessary Ruby Gem files, so that you can use `bundle exec jekyll serve` to test your blog site. This is useful in the initial setup stage for debugging. If things go well, you don't need to worry here.
